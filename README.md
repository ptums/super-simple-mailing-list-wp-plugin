# Mailing List For Blogs Widget

Custom Mailing List Widget to allow users to subscribe to our feeds based on their selected category.


### To Do:
1. Make table rows editable, and deletable (bind buttons to specific rows -- TOUGH BUG)
2. Create Email function with two inputs user email and selected categories
3. Create Shortcode with an email input, a select category link, and a list of checkbox categories
    1. Make sure that email input and categories selected show up in database
    2. Make sure that they are rendered in the table in the admin area
